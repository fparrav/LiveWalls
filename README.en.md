## ⚙️ Installation

### 📥 Download Release (Recommended)

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fparrav/LiveWalls/releases)
2. Download the latest `.dmg` file
3. Open the DMG and drag LiveWalls to Applications

### 🍺 Homebrew Installation (Recommended for advanced users)

**Don't have Homebrew?** [Install it here](https://brew.sh)

```bash
brew tap fparrav/livewalls
brew install livewalls
```

**Homebrew method advantages:**
- ✅ Automatic installation without manual configuration
- ✅ No macOS quarantine issues  
- ✅ Easy updates with `brew upgrade`

**📋 Note:** LiveWalls is not in the official Homebrew repository because it requires an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year) for signed apps. As a free open source project, we use a personal "tap" that allows secure distribution of unsigned apps.

### ⚠️ Important: Unsigned Application

**LiveWalls is an open source project** and does not have an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year).
To open the application for the first time:

#### Method 1: Terminal Command (Recommended)

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /path/to/LiveWalls.app
```

#### Method 2: System Settings

1. Try to open LiveWalls (a security warning will appear)
2. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
3. Look for "LiveWalls was blocked" and click **"Open Anyway"**

#### Method 3: Right-click

1. **Right-click** on LiveWalls.app
2. Select **"Open"** from the context menu
3. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog

### 🛠️ Compile from Source

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fparrav/LiveWalls.git
   cd LiveWalls
   ```

   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

   The compiled app will be in the `build/Debug/` folder.

## 🔒 Security and Privacy

### Required permissions

- **Accessibility**: To set the wallpaper on the desktop
- **Files and Folders**: To access selected videos

**LiveWalls is a 100% open source project** that you can review and compile yourself.

### Why isn't the app signed?

- Apple Developer membership costs $99 USD/year
- This is a free project with no commercial purpose
- You can verify the security by reviewing the source code

### How to verify security

1. **Review the source code** in this repository
2. **Compile yourself** using Xcode
3. **Inspect the build** before running it
